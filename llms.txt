# aphantasiaEmotions

aphantasiaEmotions is a data analysis project wrapped in an R package
for reproducibility[¹](#fn1). It contains the code and data to reproduce
the analyses presented in the article “*Aphantasics Process Emotions
Differently: Evidence of a Non-linear Relationship Between Visual
Imagery and Emotional Processing Abilities*”. This repository is
archived with a permanent DOI on the Open Science Framework
[here](https://osf.io/b837s/).

Below is the graphical abstract of this study, which summarises the main
finding that came out of the analyses.

Graphical abstract for the study.

## What exactly is in this R package?

The package includes the raw data used in the analyses in the form of a
built-in dataset called `all_data` to make it easily accessible and
reusable. This table is the combination of two original, previously
unpublished datasets, and three datasets from previous studies, namely
Ale & Burns (2024), Monzel et al. (2024) and Kvamme et al. (2025). The
package comes with a set of functions for manipulating the data and
reliably reproducing the analyses presented in the article. The data and
the functions are documented in detail in [the package
website](https://m-delem.github.io/aphantasiaEmotions), which also
contains a vignette with an extended analysis report containing all
analysis outputs, including those not reported in the article for
brevity.

The source code of this vignette is available in the `vignettes/` folder
of the package repository.

## Installation

You can install the development version of aphantasiaEmotions from
[GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("pak")
pak::pak("m-delem/aphantasiaEmotions")
```

Alternatively, you can clone the repository, launch the R project in
RStudio by opening the `aphantasiaEmotions.Rproj` file and run the
following command:

``` r
devtools::load_all()
#> ℹ Loading aphantasiaEmotions
#> Welcome to aphantasiaEmotions.
```

… Which will load the package and make all its functions and data
available in your R session.

1.  The R package structure was chosen to facilitate the sharing of the
    code and data with the scientific community, and to make it easy to
    reproduce the analyses. It is not intended to be a general-purpose
    package, but rather a collection of functions and data specific to
    this study (although many functions are reusable in their own
    right). The package development workflow (see [this reference
    book](https://r-pkgs.org/)) is also a good way to ensure that the
    code is well-documented and tested, which is important for
    reproducibility in scientific research.
