\arguments{
\item{model}{A fitted GAM model object.}

\item{by}{Variable name to estimate means by (default is "vviq").}

\item{length}{Number of points to estimate along the predictor variable
(default is 65, the number of unique VVIQ values).}

\item{title}{Title of the plot.}

\item{subtitle}{Subtitle of the plot.}

\item{caption}{Caption of the plot.}

\item{x_lab}{Label for the x-axis.}

\item{y_lab}{Label for the y-axis.}

\item{breaks}{Breaks for the y-axis (default uses pretty breaks).}

\item{base_theme}{Base ggplot2 theme to use with \code{\link[=theme_pdf]{theme_pdf()}}
(default is \code{ggplot2::theme_minimal}).}

\item{...}{Additional arguments passed to the \code{\link[=theme_pdf]{theme_pdf()}} function for
further customization of the plot theme.}

\item{base_size}{Base font size for the plot theme (default is 7).}
}
\value{
A ggplot2 object representing the GAM estimated means plot.
}
\description{
This function creates a plot of estimated means from a Generalized Additive
Model (GAM) using the \code{modelbased} package. It visualizes the
estimated means along with confidence intervals and allows for
customization of various plot elements such as titles, labels, and themes.
