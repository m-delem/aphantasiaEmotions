aphantasiaEmotions is a data analysis project wrapped in an R package for
reproducibility[^1]. It contains the code and data to reproduce the analyses
presented in the article "*Aphantasics Process Emotions Differently: Evidence of
a Non-linear Relationship Between Visual Imagery and Emotional Processing
Abilities*". This repository is archived with a permanent DOI on the Open
Science Framework <a href="https://osf.io/b837s/" target="_blank">here</a>.
<!-- You can read the preprint <a href="https://osf.io/b837s/" target="_blank">here</a>. -->

[^1]: The R package structure was chosen to facilitate the sharing of the code
    and data with the scientific community, and to make it easy to reproduce the
    analyses. It is not intended to be a general-purpose package, but rather a
    collection of functions and data specific to this study (although many
    functions are reusable in their own right). The package development workflow
    (see <a href="https://r-pkgs.org/" target="_blank">this reference book</a>)
    is also a good way to ensure that the code is well-documented and tested,
    which is important for reproducibility in scientific research.

Below is the graphical abstract of this study, which summarises the main finding
that came out of the analyses.

```{r, fig.alt="Graphical abstract for the study.", echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("man/figures/graphical_abstract.png")
```

## What exactly is in this R package?

The package includes the raw data used in the analyses in the form of a built-in
dataset called `all_data` to make it easily accessible and reusable. This table
is the combination of two original, previously unpublished datasets, and three
datasets from previous studies, namely @aleAphantasiaAlexithymiaPredict2024,
@monzelAffectiveProcessingAphantasia2024 and @kvammeWhenWeakImagery2025. The
package comes with a set of functions for manipulating the data and reliably
reproducing the analyses presented in the article. The data and the functions
are documented in detail in [the package website](https://m-delem.github.io/aphantasiaEmotions), which also contains a vignette
with an extended analysis report containing all analysis outputs, including 
those not reported in the article for brevity.

The source code of this vignette is available in the `vignettes/` folder of
the package repository.

## Installation

You can install the development version of aphantasiaEmotions from
[GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("pak")
pak::pak("m-delem/aphantasiaEmotions")
```

Alternatively, you can clone the repository, launch the R project in RStudio by
opening the `aphantasiaEmotions.Rproj` file and run the following command:

```{r}
devtools::load_all()
```

... Which will load the package and make all its functions and data available in
your R session.

## Citation

This GitHub repository is archived in the OSF project, which allowed to assign a
permanent DOI to the code and data. Thus, if you use this code or data in your
research, please cite the OSF project with the following:
